          <h6>6.1 Security of Your Personal Information</h6>
          <p>
            At MHN, we treat your data as an asset that must be protected
            against loss and unauthorized access. We implement robust security
            measures to safeguard your personal data, including encryption,
            secure servers, firewalls, and access controls.
          </p>
          <p>
            We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the
            personal information submitted to us and information that we have
            accessed. Our security measures are regularly evaluated to ensure

          </p>
          <p>
            However, as effective as these security measures are, no security
            system is entirely impenetrable. While we strive to protect your
            data, we cannot guarantee absolute security. Additionally, we cannot
            ensure that your information will not be intercepted while being
            transmitted over the internet.

            We work with third-party service providers to deliver our services,
            and we ensure they adhere to strict security and privacy standards.
            These providers are contractually obligated to implement appropriate
            technical and organizational measures to protect your data.
          </p>
          <h6>6.3 Data Retention and Disposal</h6>
          <p>
            We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to
            fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, or as required by
            applicable laws. Once data is no longer needed, we securely delete
            or anonymize it using industry-standard procedures.
          </p>
          <h6>6.4 User Responsibility</h6>
          <p>
            While we take every reasonable step to protect your data, it is
            essential for users to take steps to protect their information as
            well. We recommend using strong passwords, enabling multi-factor
            authentication, and keeping login credentials confidential.
          </p>
          <h6>6.5 Incident Management</h6>
          <p>
