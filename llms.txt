AI health assistant with doctor connect & secure records.

My Health Notion is an all-in-one AI-driven health platform designed for Indian users. It centralizes your medical data—prescriptions, test reports, and lifestyle logs—in one secure app while offering a personal AI health assistant (TARA). The platform’s tagline emphasizes that “managing your health should be seamless, secure, and smart”, reflecting its focus on convenience and privacy. Key features include Doctor Connect (instant audio/video consultations with physicians), Emergency SOS alerts, and Family Connect for shared health management. Users can receive AI-generated health insights and reminders based on their records and daily habits. By combining preventive care with data-driven guidance, My Health Notion helps users stay on top of wellness. The app is fully mobile-optimized and implements natural, voice-friendly content (targeting conversational queries). All pages will be schema-marked (e.g. SoftwareApplication, FAQ) and optimized for Core Web Vitals (fast load, low layout shift), ensuring top performance in mobile search. In summary, My Health Notion offers a smart, secure digital health coach and record-keeper that outshines single-feature apps by unifying AI assistance, doctor access, and emergency support in one user-friendly interface.
